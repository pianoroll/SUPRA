<h1> Operator shifts in the images </h1>

This page lists all operator shifts in the SUPRA roll images.  Shifts
are sudden displacements of the roll to the left or right in the
image.  They are sometimes needed to keep the edges of the paper
from pressing too hard against the take-up spool flanges.  Shifts
will cause image distortion, so this page is useful for looking at
the visual effects of each shift.

<h2> Shift list </h2>

The list is sorted by the size of the shift.  Negative shifts are
to the bass side of the roll and positive shifts are to the treble
side of the roll (or the other way around). Shifts are identified
down to a size of 3pixels (1/100th of an inch). Scroll the image
horizontally to view the entire width of the roll (about 1/4 of the
roll is visible in the width of the image).  The shift is centered
vertically in the image, with one inch above and below the shift
also being displayed.  When shifts occur after the last musical
hole a note is given to this effect in the position fields (highlighted
in green, meaning OK).  These end shifts do not affect musical data
extraction from the rolls.
