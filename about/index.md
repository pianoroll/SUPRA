# About SUPRA #

This website is created as a research portal. It contains links to the most recent versions of digitized rolls. It contains the [supra-rw dataset](https://purl.stanford.edu/xf457dx9166), which was presented along with the [paper](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/paper/000062.pdf) at the International Society for Music Information Retrieval's (ISMIR) 2019 conference in Delft, The Netherlands.

As of Nov. 2019, the website includes 457 Welte T-100 (red welte rolls), each links to
a search work catelog at Stanford Library (SW), roll scan image file (UV, UV+), Expressive MIDI (Mexp), Raw MIDI (Mraw), MP4, and MP3 file.
